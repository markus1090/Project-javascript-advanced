        <p>Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful
            to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.
            Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other 
            living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural or built environment. 
            Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.</p>
        <p>Would you like to know the level of air pollution in a city or in a station closer you?</p>
